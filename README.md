# Identified an issue in your community?

## How to submit a great idea
For example: “How might we better enable locals to be aware of mental health support” we consider a good problem statement, but “Let’s build a phone app to show people where the bus stops are.” we consider to be a poor problem statement. The reason for this is not to approach a project with a bunch of assumptions already made. We want to research the issue and find the best way to solve that issue.

All projects must be open-source and freely available for their entire lifetime. We host all our project code on github, and if the project doesn’t involve code we will make it openly available in some other accessible way.

Projects of a political nature have to unbiased. Projects focused on open-data, political awareness and transparency are fair game, but projects to support a particular political viewpoint are not.
